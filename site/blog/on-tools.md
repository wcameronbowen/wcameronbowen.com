I recently re-read [The Anarchist's Tool Chest (2nd edition)](https://lostartpress.com/products/the-anarchists-tool-chest?_pos=26&_sid=b40c23780&_ss=r) by [Chris Schwarz](https://christophermschwarz.com/). I resonate with the ethos. Buy good tools (good != new) and use them to build something.

I've seen companies blow cash left and right on subscriptions, tools, and products to solve their problems. Many of those tools are never deployed or fully adopted and on to buy the next shiny tool. That instinct to buy solutions has really stuck with me lately. Often the need to buy these solutions and tools is mostly arbitrary. It seems to arise out of "best practices" (or let's be honest, someone's commission). The best practice says we need all the tool acronymns: BS, more BS, and the most BS.

This struck me. Skill level reduces the need for tools. Which came first, the reduction of skill level or the tools to replace that skill? Tool sprawl isn't only a technology problem. Tool sprawl has occurred even in other crafts over the past hundred years. My rough theory is that, _your proficiency with tools is inversely correlated with the number of tools, their complexity, and the amount you paid for them._ The point is not to avoid buying tools. I'm glad someone invented the tractor, computer, car, etc. I'm supremely grateful to live in a world with so many solved problems. How do we feed billions of people? How do we communicate across great distances? How do we help those who are sick or injured? We need to solve these problems.

The dark side to solving many problems is the commoditization of innovation/solutions. Why use your brain when you can pull out your wallet? Why build anything when you can buy it? Because buying more and more solutions/tools/products to solve your problems will drive you to want more. The natural response is to then pendulum swing and recommend living in a tent (that you sewed yourself from your own sheep's skin of course) in the woods.

But, we can't do everything from first principles/scratch. When Feinstein wants to sit in a chair he doesn't start by planting a tree. So find one problem in your life that you solve by buying and instead try building. Maybe it's learning how to make your own coffee or build a bookshelf. Maybe it's learning to paint, grow vegetables, or smoke a brisket. Building, creating, overcoming, these activities are satisfying in a deep way.

Work with fewer but proven tools. Develop skills with those tools before buying more. Make things, anything.
