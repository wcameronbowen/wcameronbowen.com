I don't plan to write much about AI here, but here's my obligatory AI post. Yes, AI is amazing, AND I realized it was making me dumber so I stopped using it regularly. That doesn't even scratch the surface of the power consumption and security concerns. Sure you can make the argument, "It wasn't AI that was the problem, it was you turning off your brain to let AI do the work". You would probably be right, but why fight myself when I can just remove AI from my daily workflow completely? 

After all, AI needs human creativity to train models. If humans are all using AI instead of developing independent thoughts and creating art, etc. AI will end up in a loop consuming it's own output. I occasionally use AI. Sometimes to summarize some code or give me some examples on better patterns for code. But I don't use it to communicate for me or think for me. It's great at summarizing a lot of documentation (sometimes), and there are times when I need speed and learning is not the goal, but those times are rare.

AI is going to fundamentally change how we use technology. Not because there will be "coding" or "writing" models out there, but because the average human (not average in intelligence or ability, but average in their understanding of technology and how much time they spend thinking about it) cannot differentiate between a human and an AI model (yes, even with video and audio). This will be especially true between unfamiliar cultures, "Is that AI or just an American?" 

The average person's impact on technological development was initially low. Technology was being designed in universities and the military, but it is very clear that the most recent player to the game has impacted how technology is developed. Companies (especially the very large ones) want our eyeballs, ears, and even minds tied to their platforms. Attention is the new currency, therefore whatever will grab your attention is prioritized. I don't watch a lot of ads for various reasons, but whenever I do it feels like a 7th grader is writing the plotlines. Maybe ads have always been horrible or maybe I'm just old. Either way, my thought is usually, "People really listen to this?". Just listen to what ads say some day and think, "Is this a world you want to live in?".

I work in tech. I worked at a company developing LLM models, and I find the looming "is this really a human?" question frustrating when reading articles, and increasingly watching videos. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe the average person will have no clue and be content to be ignorant, but give it some time and a couple stories about how someone's retirement account was drained by a scammer using AI to trick someone and either the government will step in to control AI (there are lots of dystopian movies to help imagine how that will go) or the average person will just disconnect and start talking to their friends/family in person. 

I have more hope for the human race. I hope that the average person will start walking across the street to their elderly neighbor's house and check in on them. I hope that the average person will look into their kid's eyes more than they look into the .

Who knows, AI could be the best return to office strategy of them all.
