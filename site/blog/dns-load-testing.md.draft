## DNS Load Testing

Install 
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dns-oarc/dnscap
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dnscap
```

use dnscap
```
sudo dnscap -w -i vxlan1 - | sudo  tcpdump -r -
```

so far no luck, checking if any headers in capture see also [[using tcpdump in linux]]
```
tcpdump -i vxlan1 -c 5 -e
```

decapsulation seems to be working fine
looks like just something with `tcpdump` not accepting or parsing the input correctly
see traffic coming through the filters with this command
```
dnscap -i vxlan1 -w ./test.txt
```
