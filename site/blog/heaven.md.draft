I watched a show called _The Good Place_, recently. Heads up, there are probably spoilers in here if you ever plan to watch the show. After several coworkers raved about how good it was I thought, "There must be something here!". Several hilarious episodes and plot twists later, one thing that has stuck in my mind was the writer's view of heaven. Heaven is depicted as the place where "all your wishes come true". The twist of course is that after a while the characters in the show get bored. They've skydived, eaten, and experienced everything they want to boredom and in the end they just want to die. Would you want to go there? A place where you control everything and get what you want 100% of the time? We can all agree things are not right. War, disease, hunger, no one things we should keep those things. But getting everything we want seems like a horrible ideal for a place meant to be the "ultimate" destination. 

Humans don't thrive when they have everything they want though. Michael Easter in his great book, _Comfort Crisis_ talks about "problem creep". The main point being that the human brain has a minimum number of problems it needs to be analzying and if your environment is not producing those problems then your brain will manufacture problems out of things that are not problems. I see this in our children. They are not happy when they get everything they want, they are miserable and just want more. And of course because our children are to a great extent copies of us I'm the same way. I'm not happy when I get everything I want. Let's distinguish between wants and needs of course. Having all your needs fulfilled is of course a very pleasant place to be.  We've been reading through the _Little House_ book series with the kids recently. Comparing life in the late 1800s with our lives today is quite the eye opener.
