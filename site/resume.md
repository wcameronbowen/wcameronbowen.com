* Personally, reduced cloud usage by more than $960K annually by rightsizing our compute, removing
unused virtual machines, removing unused volumes, and applying tiering policies to object storage
* In addition, further reduced costs by more than $350K annually by collaborating with other groups and
driving reduction of unused resources
* Stabilized our DNS infrastructure by designing and implementing a solution leveraging Route53
Resolvers to reduce our dependence on AD servers as our primary DNS servers
